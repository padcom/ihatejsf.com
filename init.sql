It's immature and hard to understand
Components are a bitch to create!
People who created RichFaces must be morons! See the source code that created every single attribute line by line in a 10-or-more-screen method? WTF???
Documentation sucks big time!
JSF does not embrace core web technologies
Because XML != HTML+CSS+JS
Comments are not comments unless they are comments!
It uses POST for all, even for links.
JSF lacks simplicity. Totally.
The Web is inherently stateless - JSF tries to do the wrong thing all along
It is a reflection of how Sun tries to catch up to Microsoft (ASP.Net) when it had the right path all along (Struts, Spring MVC)... ASP.NET MVC now goes back to what Struts is all along
ServerSide technology, for billion users?
It doesn't suck.
There is no If statement in the templating
It uses POST for everything including links
It uses the character ":" by default when generating ids which totally screws you when trying to write CSS selectors in unit tests, selenium tests or CSS
Having multiple loops in thesame template, or nested loops totally messes mojarra up
It does not use the server's system time by default
The Flash request scope is totally messed up
It takes 1 second to toggle a button's visibility using rendered attribute
